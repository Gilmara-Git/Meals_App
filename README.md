## About

A simple app to display **meals** according to its categories. 
<p>We are able to <strong>Filter</strong> Meals and set Meals as <strong>Favorites</strong> by using Redux. So, the changes reflect throughout the entire application.</p>

## Motivation
Practice and learn **React Native** fundamentals such as Custom Components, styling, font, Images, Button(TouchableOpacity, TouchableNativeFeedback), Lists (ScrollView and FlatList), navigation and state management).
<p>In order to practice LinearGradient, I styled the FallBack Screen with LinearGradient. FallBack screen is the page displayed when the there is no Meals being filtered or there is no Meal in Favorites.</p>

## Improvements to be applied
- Adapt the 'app' to be used on smaller devices and landscape position, by explorinng the advantages of Dimensions API)


## Technologies used
- React Native
- Expo
- React Navigation (stackNavigator, bottomTabNavigator and  drawerNavigator)
- Redux (Global state management)
